# Text Compression
The goal of this project was to analyze various data compression algorithms to determine which can achieve the highest compression ratio.
* Implemented a lossless text compression system in C++ using Huffman coding algorithm to process large text files
* Built custom binary tree structure and min-heap priority queue to optimize memory usage and processing efficiency
* Analyzed character frequency patterns to generate optimal variable-length bit encodings for minimal storage overhead
* Achieved 42% file size reduction while maintaining perfect data fidelity on 19th century English text
